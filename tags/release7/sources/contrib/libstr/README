The "libstr" library provides high-level string processing functions,
some based on regular expressions. It is intended to support the kind
of file processing that is usually performed with "sed" or "perl". See
the interface file str.mli for a complete listing.

This library has been lightly tested. Please report the bugs.

This library has been contributed by Xavier Leroy (Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr).

LEGAL NOTICE: the code in the regex-0.12 subdirectory is covered by
the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). See the file regex-0.12/COPYING.
As a consequence, the libstr library is itself covered by the GPL.

USAGE:

To use the libstr library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> str.zo <other .zo and .ml files> -lstr

for the linking phase.

A toplevel system integrating the libstr functions can be run with:

        camllight camlstr
