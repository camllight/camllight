   NAME
     caml-tex - Process Caml phrases embedded in LaTeX files


   SYNOPSIS
     caml-tex [ -o output-file ] [ -n line-width ] [ -w ] input-file ...



   DESCRIPTION

     The caml-tex filter extracts Caml Light phrases embedded in LaTeX files,
     evaluates them, and insert the outcome of the evaluation after each
     phrase.

     Three LaTeX environments are provided to include Caml Light code in the
     input files:

     caml_example
          The phrases between \begin{caml_example} and \end{caml_example} are
          evaluated and copied into the output file. Each phrase is followed
          by the response of the toplevel loop.

     caml_example*
          The phrases between \begin{caml_example*} and \end{caml_example*}
          are evaluated and copied into the output file. The responses of the
          toplevel loop are discarded.

     caml_eval
          The phrases between \begin{caml_eval} and \end{caml_eval} are
          silently evaluated. They are not copied into the output file, and
          the responses of the toplevel loop are discarded.

     The resulting LaTeX code is stored in the file file.ml.tex if the input
     file has a name of the form file.tex, otherwise the name of the output
     file is the name of the input file with `.ml.tex' appended.

     The files produced by caml-tex can be directly processed by LaTeX, pro-
     vided the `caml' or `caml-sl' document style option is provided in the
     \documentstyle. The `caml' style typesets both the Caml phrases and the
     toplevel output in typewriter font. The `caml-sl' style typesets the
     input in typewriter font, and the output in slanted typewriter font.


   OPTIONS


     -o output-file
          Specify the name of a file where the LaTeX output is to be stored.
          A dash `-' causes the LaTeX output to be printed on standard out-
          put.



                                                                            1






   CAML-TEX(1)                                                   17 July 1993


     -n line-width
          Set the line width. The default is 72 characters. The responses of
          the toplevel loop are folded if they are longer than the line
          width. No folding is performed on the Caml input text.

     -w   Cause lines to be folded on a space character whenever possible,
          avoiding word cuts in the output. By default, folding occurs at the
          line width, regardless of word cuts.


   CAVEATS
     The \begin... and \end... phrases must sit on a line by themselves, with
     no characters before the backslash or after the closing brace.  Each
     Caml phrase must be terminated by `;;' at the end of a line.  Blank
     space is accepted between `;;' and the newline, but any other character
     will cause caml-tex to ignore the end of the phrase, resulting in an
     incorrect shuffling of the responses into the phrases.  (The responses
     ``lag behind''.)
