DESCRIPTION. The caml-tex filter extracts Caml Light phrases
embedded in LaTeX files, evaluates them, and insert the outcome of the
evaluation after each phrase. 

INSTALLATION. Edit the variables at the beginning of the Makefile and
do "make install".

The filter is written in Perl, so you'll need Perl version 4 installed
on your machine.

USAGE. See the manual page (caml-tex.1 or caml-tex.doc).
