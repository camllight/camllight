        Changes between Caml Light 0.5 and Caml Light 0.6
        -------------------------------------------------

* Better handling of type abbreviations. Implementing an abstract type
  as an abbreviation now works correctly.

* Debugging mode (option -g to camlc and camllight) to get access
  to the internals of module implementations.

* New library modules:
        genlex    generic lexical analyser
        set       applicative sets over ordered types
        map       applicative maps over ordered types
        baltree   balanced binary trees over ordered types

* "compile" command at toplevel (especially useful in the Macintosh version).

* New contributed libraries and tools:
        camlmode  Emacs editing mode for Caml Light
        mletags   Indexing of Caml Light source files for use with Emacs "tags"
        libnum    Arbitrary-precision arithmetic
        libstr    String operations, regular expressions

* Many bug fixes.
