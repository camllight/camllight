To compile, just edit the variable definitions at the beginning of the
Makefile, and do

        make

If everything goes well, become superuser and do

        make install

Then, to use the bignum library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> nums.zo <other .zo and .ml files> -lnums

for the linking phase.

If you'd like to have the bignum functions available at toplevel, just do

        make camlnum

to build a special toplevel named "camlnum" that comprises the bignum
functions. To run this toplevel, do

        camllight camlnum

As an example, try:

        #open "num";;
        let rec fact n =
          if n = 0 then Int 1 else mult_num (num_of_int n) (fact(n-1));;
        string_of_num(fact 1000);;
