This library relies on configuration information found in files
../../config/m.h and ../../config/s.h, as generated during the
installation of the Caml Light system.

Once these files are set up, just edit the variable definitions at the
beginning of the Makefile, and do

        make

(Ignore warnings by ranlib about .o files that have no table of
contents. These files are actually empty.)

If everything goes well, become superuser and do

        make install

Then, to use the Unix library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> unix.zo <other .zo and .ml files> -lunix

for the linking phase.

If you'd like to have the Unix functions available at toplevel, just do

        make camlunix

to build a special toplevel named "camlunix" that includes the
Unix functions.

To run this toplevel, do

        camllight camlunix
