WARNING: this is an early alpha-release, meaning that 
 * the doc is still sketchy (sic)
 * it has been partially tested
 * subject to change !


Prerequisites:
 Works only on Unix (uses fork/exec and named pipes)
 Caml Light 0.61, and the "unix" contrib
 	(NOTE: if you use Caml Light 0.6, read note below)

 Tk >=3.3 (tested on 3.6). Only the "wish" interpreter is required.


Installation steps:
1 - Check that the prerequisites are available
2 - Extract this archive in the contrib directory of Caml Light
3 - cd .../contrib/camltk; make

To install the library, first check the installation path
INSTALLDIR in camltk/Makefile and camltk/lib/Makefile.
By default, this path is : /usr/local/lib/caml-light/tk

WARNING: DO NOT set this path to the same directory as Caml Light library,
since it would overwrite some files.

Then, type "make install".







Mandatory bug fix for Caml Light 0.6 (fixed in 0.61):
-------------------------------------------
In file lib/fstring.mli, do the following change:
36c36
<   and compare_strings : string -> string -> int = 1 "compare_strings"
---
>   and compare_strings : string -> string -> int = 2 "compare_strings"
