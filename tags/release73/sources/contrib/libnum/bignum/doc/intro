Bonjour !

You have ordered our bignum package: you are going to receive NN messages
(one would be too big for the mailer). These messages are named:
INCLUDE1

These messages are shell archives built with the tool "makekit" based on
the tool "shar" (as SHell ARchiver). 

The package bignum is now available on U*ix system, VMS system and MSDOS
system.

To install the package bignum on your disk, create a directory where
you want install this package, and go there:
on U*ix system:
	mkdir bignum
        cd bignum
on VMS system:
	create /dir [.bignum]
	set def [.bignum]
on MSDOS system:
	md bignum
	cd bignum
according to the system you use.

Copy the NN messages from your mail system to this directory.
For this example, we assume you have copied the messages in files
INCLUDE2

Use your favorite text editor to strip from each of the NN messages 
the header due to the mail system; each ends at the line:

    # Remove all text above and including this line. 

In the following, we are going to use the shell archiver shar. You
can get a copy of a working VMS version of shar on the node prlvms: 
	copy prlvms::shar.exe []
	shar := $disk:[dir]shar.exe;

In the directory bignum, invoke the shell on these files:
INCLUDE3
or
INCLUDE4
according to the system you use.

The order in which you perform these NN commands must be preserved.

When you are finished, the package will have been installed in the
directory bignum. 
#include "README"

When you have built a version of the package bignum, you can test it
by invoking the test programs:
	testKerN all	- Tests the functions in the kernel
	bztest		- Tests the generic functions at the Z level

On VMS system, we suppose you have defined:
	testKerN := $disk:[dir]testKerN.exe
	bztest := $disk:[dir]bztest.exe


We hope all is well !
Please, let us know if you have any problems. 
All reported bugs will be corrected. All improvements to the package
which you send back to us will be included in the successive releases,
with an author's acknowledgement.

     Merci! and have fun ...
