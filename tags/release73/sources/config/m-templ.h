/* Processor dependencies */

#define BIG_ENDIAN

/* Define BIG_ENDIAN if the processor is big endian (the most significant
   byte of an integer stored in memory comes first). Leave BIG_ENDIAN undefined
   if the processor is little-endian (the least significant byte comes first).
*/

#define ALIGNMENT

/* Define ALIGNMENT if the processor puts alignment constraints on 16-bit and
   32-bit memory accesses. Leave ALIGNMENT undefined if the processor can
   access a 16-bit or 32-bit integer at any address.
*/

#define ALIGN_DOUBLE

/* Define ALIGN_DOUBLE if the processor requires doubles to be
   doubleword-aligned. Leave ALIGN_DOUBLE undefined if the processor supports
   word-aligned doubles. */
