* duplicate declaration of value constructor (in different types) is not
  checked. This will cause masking of value constructors
* subtype definition is not checked by tkcompiler
  Will produce an "Unbound variable" error message by the Caml compiler
  on variables of the form "type_subtype_table"
* builtin types cannot be subtyped 
* removing actions with various form of "bind" is sometimes incorrect

Missing stuff: 
	* parsing of configurations
	* widget classes (bind, ... )
	* wm functions
        * placer
