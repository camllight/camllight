\chapter{The standard library}

This chapter describes the functions provided by the Caml Light
standard library. Just as the modules from the core library, the
modules from the standard library are automatically linked with the
user's object code files by the "camlc" command. Hence, the globals
defined by these libraries can be used in standalone programs without
having to add any ".zo" file on the command line for the linking
phase. Similarly, in interactive use, these globals can be used in
toplevel phrases without having to load any ".zo" file in memory.

Unlike the modules from the core library, the modules from the
standard library are not automatically ``opened'' when a compilation
starts, or when the toplevel system is launched. Hence it is necessary
to use qualified identifiers to refer to the functions provided by these
modules, or to add \verb|#open| directives.

\section*{Conventions}

For easy reference, the modules are listed below in alphabetical order
of module names.
For each module, the declarations from its interface file are printed
one by one in typewriter font, followed by a short comment.
All modules and the identifiers they export are indexed at the end of
this report.
