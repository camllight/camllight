Edit the variable definitions at the beginning of the Makefile, and do

        make

If everything goes well, become superuser and do

        make install

Then, to use the libstr library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> str.zo <other .zo and .ml files> -lstr

for the linking phase.

If you'd like to have the string functions available at toplevel, just do

        make camlstr

to build a special toplevel named "camlstr" that comprises the string
functions. To run this toplevel, do

        camllight camlstr
