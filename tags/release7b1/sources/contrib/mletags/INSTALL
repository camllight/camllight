This version of mletags must be compiled with Caml Light v0.6 or later. It
is known not to work with release 0.5.

Check the variables CPP, BINDIR, MANEXT and MANDIR at the beginning of the
Makefile, then type 
% make
During the compilation, you will see a warning

File "parser.ml", line 11, characters 262-297:
#        input !lexer__input_chan buffer 0 n;
#        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#Warning: the value of this expression is ignored.

that you can ignore.

You should now have an operational "mletags" binary, that you can install:
% make install
