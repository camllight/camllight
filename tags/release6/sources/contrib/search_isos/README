DESCRIPTION:

  This program retrieves global values by their types.

  Given a type expression and a set of module interfaces (.zi files),
  "search_isos" displays all global values defined in the modules whose
  types match the given type.

  Type matching is performed modulo type isomorphisms, so that if you
  search for "int * string -> int", you will also get values with types
  "int -> string -> int" and "string -> int -> int", which is what you want.

USAGE:

        search_isos [-nounit] type modules or directories

  The first argument is the type expression to search. It usually needs
  to be enclosed in quotes, to prevent shell expansion. 

  The remaining arguments are either .zi files or directories,
  in which case all .zi files in the directory are searched.

  The -nounit option prevents the identification of "unit -> t" with "t".

INSTALLATION:

  Before typing make, you must have installed Caml Light, the libunix library,
  and still have the .zo and .zi files for the compiler in ../../src/compiler.
  If you have erased them, just do

        cd ../../src; make configure; make world

  Then, type "make" to build search_isos.

  To install, just copy search_isos to some directory in your PATH.
