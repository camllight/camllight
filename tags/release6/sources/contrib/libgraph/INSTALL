The libunix library must have been installed before compiling and
using this library.

This library relies on configuration information found in files
../../config/m.h and ../../config/s.h, as generated during the
installation of the Caml Light system.

Once the libunix library is installed, just edit the variable
definitions at the beginning of the Makefile, and do

        make

If everything goes well, become superuser and do

        make install

Then, to use the graphics library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> \
              unix.zo graphics.zo <other .zo and .ml files> \
              -lgraph -lunix -lX11

for the linking phase.

If you'd like to have the graphics functions available at toplevel, just do

        make camlgraph

to build a special toplevel named "camlgraph" that includes the
graphics functions.

To run this toplevel, do

        camllight camlgraph
