The "libunix" library makes many Unix system calls and system-related
library functions available to Caml Light programs. See the interface
file unix.mli for a complete listing.

The "libunix" library has been tested mostly on BSD machines, but some
care has been taken not to use too many BSD-isms.

This library has been contributed by Xavier Leroy (Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr).

For those of you who read French, this library is documented in
"Programmation du systeme Unix en Caml Light" by Xavier Leroy,
technical report 147, INRIA, 1992, available by anonymous FTP from
ftp.inria.fr, directory INRIA/publications/RT, file RT-0147.ps.Z.
The examples in the directory Examples/ come from this report.
