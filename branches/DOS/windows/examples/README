This directory contains some examples of Caml programs.

The examples can either be compiled and executed as standalone programs
(if you have a "make" utility, just type "make" in the subdirectory),
or run interactively under "caml", by executing 

                include "loadall";;

in the appropriate directory.

Examples marked (*) are taken from the book ``Le langage Caml'', by
Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy (InterEditions, 1993). Messages and
identifiers are in French.

basics:
        Three all-time favorites: Fibonacci, Eratosthene's sieve, and the
        Unix "wc" utility.

asl:
        This is the implementation of A Small Language, as described in
        part 3 of ``Functional Programming using Caml Light'', by
        Michel Mauny.

calc:
        This is a simple desk calculator that illustrates the use of camllex 
        and camlyacc.

colwheel:
        Display the "color wheel" (color space in HSB coordinates).

compress: (*)
        File compression and decompression (Huffman).

demonstr: (*)
        Tautology checker.

docteur: (*)
        A clone of Eliza.

grep: (*)
        Regular expressions and automata.

hanoi: (*)
        Animated towers of Hanoi.

kb:
        The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure for rewriting systems.
        Taken from some course notes by Gerard Huet.

minicaml: (*)
        An interpreter and typechecker for a subset of Caml.

minilogo: (*)
        An interpreter for a small language with turtle graphics.
        Requires the "libunix" and "libgraph" libraries,
        or the "camlgraph" interactive system.

pascal: (*)
        An interpreter and compiler for a subset of Pascal.
        The compiler generates code for the "picomach" program.

picomach: (*)
        An assembler and simulator for a RISC processor.

showsort:
        Graphics animation of sorting algorithms.

spirals:
        Draw a family of flashy curves.
