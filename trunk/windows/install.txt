			INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
		FOR THE WINDOWS VERSION OF CAML LIGHT

REQUIREMENTS.

A PC equipped with a 80386, 80486 or Pentium processor, running 
Windows 3.x (+Win32s), Windows 95 or Windows NT. About 1M of free space on 
the disk. 

FOR WINDOWS 3.x ONLY: INSTALLING WIN32S

Win32s is distributed as a separate file win32s.zip, at the same site that
distributes Caml Light. Unzip the win32s.zip file in a temporary directory,
then follow the instructions in the file readme.txt.

CONFIGURING CAML FOR WINDOWS

I- In the following, we assume that you have installed the Caml Light
for Windows distribution in the C:\CAML directory. If this is not the case,
replace C:\CAML by the appropriate absolute path name in the following.

The directory C:\CAML should contain the following files:

	directory BIN
	directory LIB
	directory EXAMPLES
	directory DOC
	file CAMLWIN.EXE
	file CAMLWIN.INI
	file README.TXT
	file INSTALL.TXT
	file COPYRGHT.TXT

II- Edit the C:\WINDOWS\CAMLWIN.INI file. Transform the lines in the [General]
section that read

	CmdLine=camlrun c:\caml\lib\camltop -stdlib c:\caml\lib
	HelpFile=c:\caml\doc\refman72.hlp

into

	CmdLine=camlrun <CAML_PATH>\lib\camltop -stdlib <CAML_PATH>\lib
	HelpFile=<CAML_PATH>\doc\refman72.hlp

where <CAML_PATH> is of course the directory where you have installed CAML.

If you'd like error messages in another language than English, add the
"-lang" option as follows:

	CmdLine=camlrun <CAML_PATH>\lib\camltop -stdlib <CAML_PATH>\lib	-lang <YOUR_LANG>

<YOUR_LANG> can be any of fr, es, de, it.

III- The Caml command-line tools (the batch compiler camlc.exe and other
programming tools) are distributed in the BIN subdirectory. To use them:

1- add <CAML_PATH>\BIN to the PATH variable
2- do SET CAMLLIB=<CAML_PATH>\LIB

The best way to do that is to edit AUTOEXEC.BAT, then reboot.

In addition to Windows 95, NT and 3.1, the command-line tools also run under
plain MS-DOS and any operating system that provides DPMI, such as OS/2
(untested).

IV- The DOC subdirectory contains the Caml Light reference manual in
Windows Help format. It can be read with WinHelp, or from the toplevel
application Camlwin.
