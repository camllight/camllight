			CAML LIGHT 0.71 FOR WINDOWS
			 ---- RELEASE NOTES ----


# Beta 1.0:

	This is still a limited version without graphics primitives. Only the
interactive toplevel is provided. It doesn't allow to generate stand-alone 
executables. 

# 0.0:

	Graphics primitives are implemented. Some particularities:

	- the argument of open_graph is ignored;
	- mouse_pos returns the position of the mouse in the graphic window's 
	coordinate system;
	- read_key and key_pressed return only when the event occurs into the 
	graphics window. 


	Please go on sending any suggestions and remarks concerning the 
Windows interface itself to:

	Jean-Marie.Geffroy@inria.fr
