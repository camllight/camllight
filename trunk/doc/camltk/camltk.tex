\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

\tk\ is a GUI (graphical user-interface) library for the \tcl\ language.
Normally, \tk\ is controlled from \tcl. The purpose of the \camltk\
interface is to provide a \caml\ library to control \tk\ from \caml\
programs. Thus, \tk\ can be used to program user-interfaces in \caml\
without knowledge of the \tcl\ language.

\section*{Installation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Installation}

\begin{itemize}
\item This release runs only on Unix systems.
\item You need Caml Light 0.7.
\item You need to have \tcl\ and \tk\ installed (that is, at least the
include filess and libraries). 
This release has been tested with \tcl\ 7.3 and \tk\ 3.6, but will have
problems with \tk\ 4.0 because of incompatibilities.
\end{itemize}

\section*{This documentation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{This documentation}

{\bf The present documentation is sketchy, thus some basic background
about toolkits, event-driven programming, and \tk\ is assumed.}
Documentation for \tk\ is currently available in \cite{ouster94},
\cite{welch95}, and in the {\tt man} pages of the \tk\ distribution.
What you will find here is:
\begin{description}
\item[The user's manual] : a short tutorial describing how to write \caml\
programs using the \tk\ interface and how to compile them. 
\item[The implementor's manual] : describing how the interface library is
generated from a high-level description, and some technical details on
the interface. This part is of interest mainly for
expert \tk\ users who wish to extend the interface to support more
functions, more widgets, or simply to fix bugs in test versions.
\item[The Tentative reference manual] : the collection of interface files
from the library.
\end{description}

The \camltk\ distribution also includes a first shot at a \caml\ browser,
an {\em hypertext} tool that may help in finding the types of functions or
types definitions available in \caml\ libraries.

\section*{Bug reports}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Bug reports}

% Before reporting a bug, please check the \verb|KnownBugs| file in the
% \verb|doc| directory of the distribution.
Release notes and porting problems can be found on WWW at the following
address:\\
\verb|http://pauillac.inria.fr/~rouaix/camltk-porting.html|.

Please report problems and bugs directly to \verb|Francois.Rouaix@inria.fr|
instead of \caml\ mailing lists.
Don't hesitate to make comments and suggestions, or ask questions.
