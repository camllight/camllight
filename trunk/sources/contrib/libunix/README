The "libunix" library makes many Unix system calls and system-related
library functions available to Caml Light programs. See the interface
file unix.mli for a complete listing.

The "libunix" library has been tested mostly on BSD machines, but some
care has been taken not to use too many BSD-isms.

DOCUMENTATION

See chapter 16 of the Caml Light documentation.

For those of you who read French, this library is documented in
"Programmation du systeme Unix en Caml Light" by Xavier Leroy,
technical report 147, INRIA, 1992, available by anonymous FTP from
ftp.inria.fr, directory INRIA/publications/RT, file RT-0147.ps.Z.
The examples in ./Examples/ come from this report.

INSTALLATION

This library is automatically compiled and installed with the
remainder of the Caml Light system (see ../Makefile).

During compilation, ranlib might emit warnings about .o files that
have no table of contents.  These warnings can safely be ignored: the
files in question are actually empty.

USAGE

To use the Unix library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> unix.zo <other .zo and .ml files> -lunix

for the linking phase.

If you'd like to have the Unix functions available at toplevel, just do

        camllight camlunix
