The "libgraph" library implements the portable graphics library
(module "graphics") under X11 release 4 or 5.  See the reference
manual for a description of the "graphics" module.

This library requires the "libunix" library.

It has been contributed by Xavier Leroy (Xavier.Leroy@inria.fr).


USAGE:

To use the graphics library from your programs, just do

        camlc -custom <other options> \
              unix.zo graphics.zo <other .zo and .ml files> \
              -lgraph -lunix -lX11

for the linking phase.

A toplevel system with the graphics functions available is run as follows:

        camllight camlgraph


NOTES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION:

* The argument to open_graph has the form "display geometry".
Either or both components can be omitted, but a space is required before
the geometry.

* set_font takes an X-windows font name as argument, e.g. "8x13".
The font name can contain wildcards "*".

* set_text_size has no effect. To change the text size, use set_font to 
select a font with the desired size.

* fill_poly uses the "even-odd rule", which explains why some points
"inside" the polygon are not traced if the polygon outline intersects 
itself in non-trivial ways (e.g. a pentagram).

* Most X servers restrict the number of colors that can be simultaneously
displayed on the screen. set_color will usually try to find the best
approximation of the required color, but there are no guarantees that the
actual color will exactly match the given R, G, B specification.

* User interrupts are ignored while waiting for an event (with
wait_next_event). The interruption is processed when wait_next_event
returns.
