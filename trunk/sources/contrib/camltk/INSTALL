WARNING: this is an early alpha-release, meaning that 
 * the doc is still sketchy (sic)
 * it has been partially tested
 * subject to change !


Prerequisites:
 Works only on Unix (uses fork/exec and named pipes)
 Caml Light 0.6, and the "unix" contrib
 Tk >=3.3 (tested on 3.6). Only the "wish" interpreter is required.


Installation steps:
1 - Check that the prerequisites are available
2 - Extract this archive in the contrib directory of Caml Light
3 - cd .../contrib/camltk; make

To install the library, first check the installation path
INSTALLDIR in camltk/Makefile and camltk/lib/Makefile.
By default, this path is : /usr/local/lib/caml-light/tk

WARNING: DO NOT set this path to the same directory as Caml Light library,
since it would overwrite some files.

Then, type "make install".
