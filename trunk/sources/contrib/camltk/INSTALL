WARNING: this is an alpha-release, partially tested

Prerequisites:
 Works only on Unix
 Caml Light 0.61, and the "unix" contrib
 	(NOTE: if you use Caml Light 0.6, read note below)
 Tk >=3.3 (tested on 3.6). A full installation of Tcl/Tk is required
    (includes, librairies libtcl.a and libtk.a, wish interpreter)

Installation steps:
1 - Check that the prerequisites are available
2 - Extract this archive in the contrib directory of Caml Light
3 - Edit the file Makefile.x to reflect your installation,
    and save it as Makefile.config.

4 - cd .../contrib/camltk; make
    This will produce the tkcompiler, the library and toplevels.

5 (optional) - make examples


Then, type "make install". You're set.






Mandatory bug fix for Caml Light 0.6 (fixed in 0.61):
-------------------------------------------
In file lib/fstring.mli, do the following change:

<   and compare_strings : string -> string -> int = 1 "compare_strings"
---
>   and compare_strings : string -> string -> int = 2 "compare_strings"
