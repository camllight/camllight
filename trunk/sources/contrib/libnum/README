The "libnum" library implements exact-precision rational arithmetic.
It is built upon the state-of-the-art BigNum arbitrary-precision
integer arithmetic package, and therefore achieves very high
performance (it's faster than Maple, for instance).

This library is derived from Valerie Menissie-Morain's implementation
of rational arithmetic for Caml V3.1 (INRIA), and builds on the BigNum
package developed by Bernard Serpette, Jean Vuillemin and Jean-Claude
Herve (INRIA and Digital PRL). Xavier Leroy (INRIA) did the Caml Light
port.

This library is documented in "The CAML Numbers Reference Manual" by 
Valerie Menissie-Morain, technical report 141, INRIA, july 1992,
available by anonymous FTP from ftp.inria.fr, directory
INRIA/publications/RT, file RT-0141.ps.Z.

LEGAL NOTICE:

This work uses the BigNum package developed jointly by INRIA and Digital PRL.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

64-bit architectures are not yet fully supported.  The test suite passes on 
a Dec Alpha, but some bugs remain.
