Now, to build or modify the current version of the package, type one of:

   on U*ix system:
	make vax	- to use vax assembly code
	make 68K	- to use 68020 assembly code
	make ns		- to use NS assembly code
	make mips	- to use mips assembly code
	make pyramid	- to use pyramid assembly code
	make i960	- to use intel 80960 assembly code
	make sparc	- to use sparc assembly code (SunOS 4)
	make sparcfpu	- to use sparc assembly code (with multiply in FPU)
	make supersparc	- to use sparc V8 assembly code (Sun OS 4)
        make sparc-solaris
        make sparcfpu-solaris  same as above, for Solaris 2 instead of SunOS 4
        make supersparc-solaris
	make C16	- to use C code with 16 bits digits
	make C32	- to use C code with 32 bits digits (default version)

   on VMS system: (copy VMSmakefile to Makefile, before)
	mms vax		- to use vax assembly code (default version)
	mms C32		- to use C code with 32 bits digits 
   we suppose you have defined the standard libraries of C-VMS with:
        define  lnk$library  sys$library:vaxccurse
        define  lnk$library_1  sys$library:vaxcrtlg
        define  lnk$library_2  sys$library:vaxcrtl

   on MSDOS system: (copy MSDOSmakefile to Makefile, before)
	make makefile	- to use C code (16 bits digits)

Each of these commands products the following files:

   on U*ix system:
	BigNum.a	- BigNum library
	testKerN	- Test program executable for KerN
	bztest		- Test program executable for BigZ

   on VMS system:
	BigNum.olb	- BigNum library
	testKerN.exe	- Test program executable for KerN
	bztest.exe	- Test program executable for BigZ

   on MSDOS system:
	BigNum.lib	- BigNum library
	testKerN.exe	- Test program executable for KerN
	bztest.exe	- Test program executable for BigZ


On U*ix system, if you have the tools LaTeX (L. Lamport's special version of Knuth's
famous TeX, as described in the Addison-Wesley book), makeindex and
dvips, type: 
	make doc	- to build the Postscript files of the documents, 

If you do not have dvips, use your local equivalent tool to print
the dvi file produced by the LaTeX command.
