Here is a short description for each program. Some more explanation
is sometimes given as comments in the source.

backup          sh      Used during the bootstrap phase, to keep
restore                 backup copies of the compiler and linker.

camldep         perl    Find inter-module dependencies between .zi and
                        .zo files. The output is intended to go in a
                        Makefile.

camlsize        perl    Print the code, data and symbol size of a
                        executable bytecode file

checkmsgs       perl    Check the consistency of the camlmsgs.txt file

dumpobj         caml    Disassemble a .zo file.

dumpsymb        caml    Dump the debugging information contained in a
                        executable bytecode file.

findmsgs        caml    Scan the source code for messages to internationalize.
                        Used by checkmsgs.

linkarch        sh      Builds a directory hierarchy that parallels
                        the source hierarchy, with symbolic links to
                        the source files. Useful when compiling Caml Light
                        on several platforms at once.

make-jumptable  awk     Used to generate ../runtime/jumptbl.h and
make-opcodes            ../compiler/opcodes.ml from ../runtime/instruct.h.

clprepro        C       Use this as a replacement for cpp if your cpp is
			too fussy (e.g. refuses 008 as a token)
