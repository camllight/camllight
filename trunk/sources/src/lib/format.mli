(* Pretty printing *)

(* This module implements a pretty-printing facility to format text
   within ``pretty-printing boxes''. The pretty-printer breaks lines
   at specified break hints, and indents lines according to the box
   structure. *)

(* Rule of thumb for casual users:
-   use simple boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);
-   use simple break hints (as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a
   simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that ouputs a space
   indicating a break hint);
-   once a box is opened, display its material with basic printing
   functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);
-   when the material for a box has been printed, call [close_box ()] to
   close the box;
-   at the end of your routine, evaluate [print_newline ()] to close
   all remaining boxes and flush the pretty-printer. *)

(* You may alternatively consider this module as providing an extension to the
   [printf] facility: you can simply add pretty-printing annotations to your
   regular printf formats, as explained below in the documentation of
   the function [fprintf]. *)

(* The behaviour of pretty-printing commands is unspecified
   if there is no opened pretty-printing box. Each box opened via
   one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]
   for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the
   boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly. *)

(* In case of interactive use, the system closes all opened boxes and
   flushes all pending text (as with the [print_newline] function)
   after each phrase. Each phrase is therefore executed in the initial
   state of the pretty-printer. *)

(*** Boxes *)
value open_box : int -> unit;;
        (* [open_box d] opens a new pretty-printing box
           with offset [d]. 
           This box is the general purpose pretty-printing box.
           Material in this box is displayed ``horizontal or vertical'':
           break hints inside the box may lead to a new line, if there
           is no more room on the line to print the remainder of the box,
           or if a new line may lead to a new indentation
           (demonstrating the indentation of the box).
           When a new line is printed in the box, [d] is added to the
           current indentation. *)
value close_box : unit -> unit;;
        (* Close the most recently opened pretty-printing box. *)

(*** Formatting functions *)
value print_string : string -> unit;;
        (* [print_string str] prints [str] in the current box. *)
value print_as : int -> string -> unit;;
        (* [print_as len str] prints [str] in the
           current box. The pretty-printer formats [str] as if
           it were of length [len]. *)
value print_int : int -> unit;;
        (* Print an integer in the current box. *)
value print_float : float -> unit;;
        (* Print a floating point number in the current box. *)
value print_char : char -> unit;;
        (* Print a character in the current box. *)
value print_bool : bool -> unit;;
        (* Print an boolean in the current box. *)

(*** Break hints *)
value print_space : unit -> unit;;
        (* [print_space ()] is used to separate items (typically to print
           a space between two words). 
           It indicates that the line may be split at this
           point. It either prints one space or splits the line.
           It is equivalent to [print_break 1 0]. *)
value print_cut : unit -> unit;;
        (* [print_cut ()] is used to mark a good break position.
           It indicates that the line may be split at this 
           point. It either prints nothing or splits the line.
           This allows line splitting at the current
           point, without printing spaces or adding indentation.
           It is equivalent to [print_break 0 0]. *)
value print_break : int -> int -> unit;;
        (* Insert a break hint in a pretty-printing box.
           [print_break nspaces offset] indicates that the line may
           be split (a newline character is printed) at this point,
           if the contents of the current box does not fit on one line.
           If the line is split at that point, [offset] is added to
           the current indentation. If the line is not split,
           [nspaces] spaces are printed. *)

value print_flush : unit -> unit;;
        (* Flush the pretty printer: all opened boxes are closed,
           and all pending text is displayed. *)
value print_newline : unit -> unit;;
        (* Equivalent to [print_flush] followed by a new line. *)

value force_newline : unit -> unit;;
        (* Force a newline in the current box. Not the normal way of
           pretty-printing, you should prefer break hints. *)
value print_if_newline : unit -> unit;;
        (* Execute the next formatting command if the preceding line
           has just been split. Otherwise, ignore the next formatting
           command. *)

(*** Margin *)
value set_margin : int -> unit;;
        (* [set_margin d] sets the value of the right margin
           to [d] (in characters): this value is used to detect line
           overflows that leads to split lines.
           Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2 or
           bigger than 999999999. *)
value get_margin : unit -> int;;
        (* Return the position of the right margin. *)

(*** Maximum indentation limit *)
value set_max_indent : int -> unit;;
        (* [set_max_indent d] sets the value of the maximum
           indentation limit to [d] (in characters):
           once this limit is reached, boxes are rejected to the left,
           if they do not fit on the current line.
           Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2 or
           bigger than 999999999. *)
value get_max_indent : unit -> int;;
        (* Return the value of the maximum indentation limit (in
           characters). *)

(*** Formatting depth: maximum number of boxes allowed before ellipsis *)
value set_max_boxes : int -> unit;;
        (* [set_max_boxes max] sets the maximum number
           of boxes simultaneously opened.
           Material inside boxes nested deeper is printed as an
           ellipsis (more precisely as the text returned by
           [get_ellipsis_text ()]).
           Nothing happens if [max] is not greater than 1. *)
value get_max_boxes : unit -> int;;
        (* Return the maximum number of boxes allowed before ellipsis. *)
value over_max_boxes : unit -> bool;;
        (* Test the maximum number of boxes allowed have
           already been opened. *)

(*** Advanced formatting *)
value open_hbox : unit -> unit;;
        (* [open_hbox ()] opens a new pretty-printing box.
           This box is ``horizontal'': the line is not split in this box
           (new lines may still occur inside boxes nested deeper). *)
value open_vbox : int -> unit;;
        (* [open_vbox d] opens a new pretty-printing box
           with offset [d]. 
           This box is ``vertical'': every break hint inside this
           box leads to a new line.
           When a new line is printed in the box, [d] is added to the
           current indentation. *)
value open_hvbox : int -> unit;;
        (* [open_hvbox d] opens a new pretty-printing box
           with offset [d]. 
           This box is ``horizontal-vertical'': it behaves as an
           ``horizontal'' box if it fits on a single line,
           otherwise it behaves as a ``vertical'' box.
           When a new line is printed in the box, [d] is added to the
           current indentation. *)
value open_hovbox : int -> unit;;
        (* [open_hovbox d] opens a new pretty-printing box
           with offset [d]. 
           This box is ``horizontal or vertical'': break hints
           inside this box may lead to a new line, if there is no more room
           on the line to print the remainder of the box.
           When a new line is printed in the box, [d] is added to the
           current indentation. *)

(*** Tabulations *)
value open_tbox : unit -> unit;;
        (* Open a tabulation box. *)
value close_tbox : unit -> unit;;
        (* Close the most recently opened tabulation box. *)
value print_tbreak : int -> int -> unit;;
        (* Break hint in a tabulation box.
           [print_tbreak spaces offset] moves the insertion point to
           the next tabulation ([spaces] being added to this position).
           Nothing occurs if insertion point is already on a
           tabulation mark.
           If there is no next tabulation on the line, then a newline
           is printed and the insertion point moves to the first
           tabulation of the box.
           If a new line is printed, [offset] is added to the current
           indentation. *)
value set_tab : unit -> unit;;
        (* Set a tabulation mark at the current insertion point. *)
value print_tab : unit -> unit;;
        (* [print_tab ()] is equivalent to [print_tbreak (0,0)]. *)

(*** Ellipsis *)
value set_ellipsis_text : string -> unit;;
        (* Set the text of the ellipsis printed when too many boxes
           are opened (a single dot, [.], by default). *)
value get_ellipsis_text : unit -> string;;
        (* Return the text of the ellipsis. *)

(*** Redirecting formatter output *)
value set_formatter_out_channel : out_channel -> unit;;
        (* Redirect the pretty-printer output to the given channel. *)

value set_formatter_output_functions :
      (string -> int -> int -> unit) -> (unit -> unit) -> unit;;
        (* [set_formatter_output_functions out flush] redirects the
           pretty-printer output to the functions [out] and [flush].
           The [out] function performs the pretty-printer output.
           It is called with a string [s], a start position [p],
           and a number of characters [n]; it is supposed to output
           characters [p] to [p+n-1] of [s]. The [flush] function is
           called whenever the pretty-printer is flushed using
           [print_flush] or [print_newline]. *)
value get_formatter_output_functions :
        unit -> (string -> int -> int -> unit) * (unit -> unit);;
        (* Return the current output functions of the pretty-printer. *)

(*** Multiple formatted output *)
type formatter;;
        (* Abstract data type corresponding to a pretty-printer and
           all its machinery.
           Defining new pretty-printers permits the output of
           material in parallel on several channels.
           Parameters of the pretty-printer are local to the pretty-printer:
           margin, maximum indentation limit, maximum number of boxes
           simultaneously opened, ellipsis, and so on, are specific to
           each pretty-printer and may be fixed independently.
           A new formatter is obtained by calling the [make_formatter]
           function. *)

value std_formatter : formatter;;
        (* The standard formatter used by the formatting functions
           above. It is defined using [make_formatter] with

           [fun () -> flush stdout]. *)

value err_formatter : formatter;;
        (* A formatter to use with formatting functions below for
           output to standard error. It is defined using [make_formatter] with

        (* [make_formatter out flush] returns a new formatter that
           writes according to the output function [out], and flushing
           function [flush]. Hence, a formatter to out channel [oc]

           [arg1] to [argN] according to the format string [format],
           and outputs the resulting string on the formatter [ff].
           The format is a character string which contains three types of
           objects: plain characters and conversion specifications as
           specified in the [printf] module, and pretty-printing
           indications.
           The pretty-printing indication characters are introduced by
           a [@] character, and their meanings are:
-          [\[]: open a pretty-printing box. The type and offset of the
           box may be optionally specified with the following syntax:
           the [<] character, followed by an optional box type indication,
           then an optional integer offset, and the closing [>] character. 
           Box type is one of [h], [v], [hv], or [hov],
           which stand respectively for an horizontal, vertical,
           ``horizontal-vertical'' and ``horizontal or vertical'' box.
-          [\]]: close the most recently opened pretty-printing box.
-          [,]: output a good break as with [print_cut ()].
-          [ ]: output a space, as with [print_space ()].
-          [\n]: force a newline, as with [force_newline ()].
-          [;]: output a good break as with [print_break]. The
           [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break may be
           optionally specified with the following syntax: 
           the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,
           then an integer offset, and a closing [>] character. 
-          [?]: flush the pretty printer and output a new line, as with
           [print_flush ()].
-          [.]: flush the pretty printer as with [print_newline ()].
-          [@]: a plain [@] character. *)
